## 📖 Project Description

This project is a fully functional **To-Do List App** built using **React + Vite** and styled with **Material UI (MUI)**.  
It allows users to add, complete, edit, and delete tasks with real-time toast notifications.  
Tasks are persisted automatically using the browser's `localStorage`.

The app supports **Arabic RTL layout**, a custom Material UI theme (with **Alexandria** font), and a modular structure using custom **React Contexts**.
